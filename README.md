# Borderless Window

## Description

Bring borderless fullscreen mode to minecraft, toggled when F7 is pressed by default.

## Configuration File

The configuration file is **${GAMEDIR}/config/blw.cfg**, whose **${GAMEDIR}** usually refers to **.minecraft**. The only key inside this file means whether borderless fullscreen mode is toggled on boot.

## Build

I know few about Java(and gradle) and IDK why I cannot build it any more XD. But the fact is that I used to successfully build it based on these code and configs.
