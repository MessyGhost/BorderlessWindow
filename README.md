# Previous Versions

These previous versions only work on Windows x64, since they are based on JNI and Windows API(s). 

Based on this(ugly code), I decide not to publish their source code. (However, an additional reason is that I mistakenly deleted the source code of the forge versions XD)

Note: The DLL file will be extracted to **\libraries\io\github\messyghost\borderlesswindow** under **${GAMEDIR}**(usually **.minecraft**) and you can delete it if you want to uninstall this mod :).
